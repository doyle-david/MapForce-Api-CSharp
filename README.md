# MapForce-Api-CSharp
This repository contains a Visual Studio 2013 C# solution for a console application that takes a MapForce (.mfd) file and an input file, and using the MapForce API runs the input file through the transformation defined in the MapForce file to produce an output XML file.

This solution uses the Windows API to manage the MapForce application window and the Popup windows that are displayed by the application.
